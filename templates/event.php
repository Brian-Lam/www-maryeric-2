									<h3>Thank you!</h3>

									<p>We are very thankful to have such wonderful family and friends who have helped shape us into the people and couple we are today. We are so excited about the chance to celebrate our marriage and spend time with all of you, whether it is at our wedding in Illinois or over phone/email for those that are not able to attend on the 3rd. Much love, Mary and Eric </p>
